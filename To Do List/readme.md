# Simple To Do List

This app is a simple to-do list with an input field and a button to add new to-do items. The input field has placeholder text where the user can input items. "When the user submits the form, the input value is added as a new item to the list. Each item can be clicked to toggle a "completed" class, which crosses out the item to indicate that it has been completed.

This app was updated to include a categories section, where the user can assign tasks to a specified category. Finally, bootstrap was used to style the application.
